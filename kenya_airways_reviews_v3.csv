Culture03633848879,Very BAD.,"Very very bad experience on Kenyan airways on the outbound and inbound. We flew to Nairobi. From there connected to go to Lagos, instead of landing the pilot went up, came back again and instead of landing went up. We landed in Contonou for 5 hours. We weren’t allowed to disembark there. Returning to SA was just as bad. The pilot announced we need to turn back to Nairobi after being in the air for about 1:30min. People who missed connecting flights were not refunded. We slept on the bench till morning waiting for a new flight that was to leave at 7:45. Don’t book Kenyan airways rather use direct flights or alternatives like SAA. It’s sad that we have to rely on such unreliable airlines when in SA we had real world class.",2,Feb-25,Negative
Mr_Mrs_Jones1,Excellent customer service,Thank you Sanobar for promptly checking in my luggage and checking for leg room seat availability. I hope she gets given a recognition for her excellent customer service.,5,Mar-25,Positive
Nicole N,Worst experience ever.,The absolute worst. Their website and app are awful and not user friendly when trying to check in. I paid for upgraded leg room seats and luckily I printed and saved the confirmation email with my upgraded seats/payments because at check in they made us choose different seats and try to pay again for the ones we had. I would NEVER recommend them. Try flying another airline if at all possible!,1,Mar-25,Negative
Travelbug35805,Good with the bad,"Flight was an Embraer 190 regional jet. We were in first class in the first row. The food was very good and the service was decent. The plane was clean. The one downfall was the fact that after the meal service ended, the crew sat in the galley area chatting and chatting basically through the rest of the flight. Not only did it portray a careless attitude towards the passengers, the noise was distracting, particularly in the front row. Maybe the last row would have been better.",3,Mar-25,Neutral
Maria Z,29 Feb 2025. Microaggressive crew member,"I travelled on 28 th February from Amsterdam to Entebbe and bought business class for myself and kids because I needed extra leg room for my baby who was 2. I was confused by the utter lack of service, compassion and even extremely bad service from the crew members particularly one woman who conveniently took off her badge name but was servicing seats from seats 5B. I was not shown where to change my baby, every time I asked for something like milk or even water, I got nasty looks from this woman flight attendant. I was completely dismayed. I will never be flying this airline again and would not recommend anyone spending so much money more especially on business class. Luckily my connecting flight from Nairobi to Entebbe on 29 th February had more professional crew and the service was miles away from what I got before.",2,Feb-25,Negative
Anders P,4 faultless flights...,"Flew Kigali-Nairobi-Dar and return mid-March 2025. Aircrafts were all on ageing B737-800, except the 1st leg was on the smaller Embraer 190. A flight cancellation was clearly announced 10 days in advance, allowing for alternative and even better options compared to original schedule. All flights on time, FAs, catering and seating were all good. Could select my preferred exit seat free with ample legroom through KQs homepage. Transfers in Nairobi were smooth. Two-three pieces of luggage were received well (both ways). Paid access to lounge in Nairobi discounted to 25 USD due to Silver status with Kenya airways. Miles earned and given, generous luggage allowance, together with the inexpensive ticket make this detour over Nairobi worth the trouble as compared to direct flight alternatives. All flights on time.",5,Mar-25,Positive
gautierm546,"I trusted them as they were part of Syteam, DON'T DO THE SAME MISTAKE.","KenyaAirways lost my luggages, no info for 5 days, and when somehow they reappear (although I have twice to go to the airport to recover them, which also costed me money), again 0 response regarding a fair first necessity compensation for buying clothes. I was in flip flop in winter in Europe with no spare boxer, no spare socks... I trusted them as they were part of Syteam, DON'T DO THE SAME MISTAKE.",1,Feb-25,Negative
Relax786453,WORST,"THE WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD. EACH REP LIE AND POINT FINGERS. NO ONE IS WILLING TO ASSIST AND SOLVE THE ISSUE. NO EMPATHY FOR ELDERLY TRAVELLING. 18 HOURS DELAY WITHOUT GIVING ANY ACCOMODATION, 6 CALLS TO CUSTOMER SERVICE, TRANSFER DESK AND THE LOUNGE AND ALL OF THEM WOULD NOT MAKE A SIMPLE DECISION TO ACCOMODATE A CUSTOMER RATHER STATING WE NEED AN EMAIL TO DIRECT US TO PROVIDE ACCOMODATION AND NO ONE COULD WRITE SUCH EMAIL. WORSE EXPERIENCE EVER",1,Mar-25,Negative
melissarouxnc,They charge me extra at the airport,"They charged me an extra 55 USD for my luggage, even thought I’ve paid for the 30kg suitcase. In South Africa, they didn't charge me, but in the transit in Kenya they wouldn't let me go - even thought my suitcase was not even with me!",2,Mar-25,Negative
Mihail M,"Never use this airline, unless you hate yourself","The organization skills of this airline is terrible. My flight was cancelled in front of my eyes, just because the airplane got full. I was placed on a hotel, which was with bad service. The transport was extremely terrible and unsafe. Nothing works on schedule. The only good thing is that the staff speak good English.",1,Mar-25,Negative
Jay's J,Utterly Incompetent - Seat Given Away After Check-In!,"Kenya Airways has demonstrated a shocking level of incompetence. After checking in and receiving my boarding pass, they gave my seat away. I was then left stranded in Kigali for SIX HOURS while they scrambled to find a replacement. This is unacceptable. The lack of communication and disregard for passengers is appalling. Avoid this airline at all costs if you value your time and sanity.",1,Feb-25,Negative
