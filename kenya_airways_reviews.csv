Culture03633848879,Very BAD.,"Very very bad experience on Kenyan airways on the outbound and inbound. We flew to Nairobi. From there connected to go to Lagos, instead of landing the pilot went up, came back again and instead of landing went up. We landed in Contonou for 5 hours. We weren’t allowed to disembark there. Returning to SA was just as bad. The pilot announced we need to turn back to Nairobi after being in the air for about 1:30min. People who missed connecting flights were not refunded. We slept on the bench till morning waiting for a new flight that was to leave at 7:45. Don’t book Kenyan airways rather use direct flights or alternatives like SAA. It’s sad that we have to rely on such unreliable airlines when in SA we had real world class.",2,Feb-25,Negative
Nicole N,Worst experience ever.,The absolute worst. Their website and app are awful and not user friendly when trying to check in. I paid for upgraded leg room seats and luckily I printed and saved the confirmation email with my upgraded seats/payments because at check in they made us choose different seats and try to pay again for the ones we had. I would NEVER recommend them. Try flying another airline if at all possible!,1,Mar-25,Negative
Travelbug35805,Good with the bad,"Flight was an Embraer 190 regional jet. We were in first class in the first row. The food was very good and the service was decent. The plane was clean. The one downfall was the fact that after the meal service ended, the crew sat in the galley area chatting and chatting basically through the rest of the flight. Not only did it portray a careless attitude towards the passengers, the noise was distracting, particularly in the front row. Maybe the last row would have been better.",3,Mar-25,Neutral
Maria Z,29 Feb 2025. Microaggressive crew member,"I travelled on 28 th February from Amsterdam to Entebbe and bought business class for myself and kids because I needed extra leg room for my baby who was 2. I was confused by the utter lack of service, compassion and even extremely bad service from the crew members particularly one woman who conveniently took off her badge name but was servicing seats from seats 5B. I was not shown where to change my baby, every time I asked for something like milk or even water, I got nasty looks from this woman flight attendant. I was completely dismayed. I will never be flying this airline again and would not recommend anyone spending so much money more especially on business class. Luckily my connecting flight from Nairobi to Entebbe on 29 th February had more professional crew and the service was miles away from what I got before.",2,Feb-25,Negative
Anders P,4 faultless flights...,"Flew Kigali-Nairobi-Dar and return mid-March 2025. Aircrafts were all on ageing B737-800, except the 1st leg was on the smaller Embraer 190. A flight cancellation was clearly announced 10 days in advance, allowing for alternative and even better options compared to original schedule. All flights on time, FAs, catering and seating were all good. Could select my preferred exit seat free with ample legroom through KQs homepage. Transfers in Nairobi were smooth. Two-three pieces of luggage were received well (both ways). Paid access to lounge in Nairobi discounted to 25 USD due to Silver status with Kenya airways. Miles earned and given, generous luggage allowance, together with the inexpensive ticket make this detour over Nairobi worth the trouble as compared to direct flight alternatives. All flights on time.",5,Mar-25,Positive
gautierm546,"I trusted them as they were part of Syteam, DON'T DO THE SAME MISTAKE.","KenyaAirways lost my luggages, no info for 5 days, and when somehow they reappear (although I have twice to go to the airport to recover them, which also costed me money), again 0 response regarding a fair first necessity compensation for buying clothes.

Dale M,Very very bad,"Online check in wasn't working (I tried 24 hours, the following morning , and 3 hours before check in) online check in gave message that it was to check in at counter. Queue for flight was exceptionally long , only 2 counters operating and each check in was taking about 15 minutes. Took me more than 2 hours to reach counter only to be told I had been downgraded to a much later flight because they had overfilled the plane. Told them i would miss my connecting flight to the Mara. They told me to phone my travel agent , but i couldn’t do that because agent is overseas and the time difference ment office closed. The check in staff were moody and unhelpful (she didn't even say good afternoon after i greeted her). I was then pointed to a counter to get a voucher for hotel to wait for next flight. Lady at kenya airways counter said i would have to wait for all the downgraded passengers to be put onto a single voucher . This would have taken literally hours. She took a photo of my voucher and said the hotel will accept that . Caught a bus to the hotel only to be told by the hotel staff that the hotel will not accept a photo of the voucher. The hotel check in staff told me kenya airways knows this , and that they should have given me a physical voucher. Fortunately, the hotel staff went out of their way to assist and told me kenya airways often make such mistakes. As i write this , i am waiting for the next kenya airways flight , I just hope there isn’t similar issues with the next flight. I will never fly with Kenya airways again.",1,Jan-25,Negative
Voyage03531...,I can't imagine a worse experience,"Just had the most shocking experience with Kenya airways. After checking my email and their website before departing for the airport, we arrived to find the flight had been cancelled with no notification. The excuse they gave was a sick pilot but research on reviews shows that KA routinely cancel flights that aren't full. Those who had booked through 3rd party suppliers actually had an upper hand as they got a couple of hours more notice. The next available flight was indirect but other passengers got there first despite promises by Kenya airways we were being booked on. We found out 5 hours later they never booked us on. They said their shift is finishing and someone will call me in the afternoon (8 hours later!!). They suggested going on their own flight 2 days later but we would miss our connecting flight if we did that and they won't cover lost hotel bills or onward costs. Also they could just cancel that flight again and it was at 3am so another disrupted night wasn't humanly possible. We had to buy an alternative flight from another airline for the following day. Kenya airways do no issue refunds for cancellations or delays unless you cancel your whole booking so that would jeopardise your return leg. They also do not give meal vouchers. Every step of the way they have been really bad. I honestly cannot believe this airline is still functioning. I suggest all prospective passengers choose alternative airlines so this one can just fail as it's meant to. If you must go with KA ensure you have good travel insurance and don't plan connecting flights close to the time - leave at least 2 days gap. Also don't have any expectations.",1,Jan-25,Negative

I got to the airport 3:30 am for my 6:30 flight. KQ staff did not want to take responsibility stating I was late. I had to show them several emails from KQ for the changes. I had a severely disabled grandson with me. Who does not communicate. KQ staff were not very sympathetic unfortunately. They told me they would rebook me for tomorrows flight as if I went with the changed flight I would not be able to connect to the London bound flight.

AjithD34,Always changing flight details and aircrafts,Absolute terrible. You book a certain flight with a certain aircraft and Kenya Airways continuously change the aircraft. We went from a Boeing Dreamliner to a small Winglets plane. These plane are changed without any notification. I understand that things change but the smaller aircrafts have no inflight entertainment. They then make you pay for seats together. They allocated seats that split my family and said I must pay to sit together and they say there's nothing they can do.,1,Dec-24,Negative

There were only 2 men on the flight, one named Obote who was a great asset to their team and the culprit who did not have on a name tag. I was seated in 12G in a chair that was slightly reclined. I tried to move the seat up but to no avail. Prior to ttakeoff this unnamed idiot came to me without saying a word to me, and started aggressively trying to move up my seat. It loudly stated that the seat would not move up to its proper place. He turned away rudely. I mentioned his ill behaved manner to Obote who apologized on his colleagues behalf. This she bustard came to me when doing dutyfree and put the magazine in my face without asking if I wanted duty free. I gave it back. Not sure if he has a problem with his mother or other women but I have never seen this type of exist behavior before in all of my travels worldwide. I already had to deal with a delayed and cancelled flight and now this behavior. I won't be recommending this 'pride of africa' airline to any of my colleagues.",1,Dec-24,Negative

itten2018,"Not the pride of Africa, but the shadow of Africa","As a Flying Blue Silver member, this is the second time we have flown Business Class with Kenya Airways.
Last year in 2023 everything went smoothly and we were satisfied with the airline.
This year 2024, Kenya Airways first postponed our flight from Paris to Nairobi by half a day. Instead of 8:30 pm to 11:00 am This was ok as they gave us about 3 weeks notice. Nevertheless, in our case we had to book a hotel in Paris.
During our trip, Kenya Airways then canceled our connecting flight from Nairobi to Zanzibar. This resulted in a transit time of 10 hours through the night in Nairobi.
Instead of organizing everything for the passengers, they wanted us to fill out an e-visa for Kenya on our own so that we could get to a hotel. It was already close to midnight and we were just tired and the program for the visa application kept throwing us out. After an hour, we abandoned the exercise and spent the night at the airport.
Kenya Airways has been canceling their flights a lot lately and the way they handle this is not at all professional.
The inflight product and crew are friendly and professional. But what is with the management and operation is more than sad and unacceptable.
We didn't even get any compensation and or a sincere apology.",1,Nov-24,Negative

Global4143571...,Pure fraud,"We decided not to take our first flight from Nairobi to mombasa. We looked on the kenya airways website on how to notify of our absence or cancel our flight, but we were told we could only cancel our full round trip or nothing at all, so we did not cancel. When we showed up for our return flight from Mombasa, we were told that our return tickets had been canceled without notification because we did not cancel our first flight (read above: not an actual option), that the flight was full, and that if we wanted a new flight we would be charged the cost of the new flight plus a change fee. We cut our losses and booked with a new airline.

To sum up:
1. Kenya airways lied to us about their no-show policy,
2. Cancelled our reservation without telling us (we asked, and this is their deliberate policy),
3. Tried to gouge us for even more money.

Thieves. Fraud. Stay away.",1,Nov-24,Negative
